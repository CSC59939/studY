### Welcome to StudY!
The purpose of this project is to bring New York City college students together and help them organize study groups to share  information, knowledge, and expertise about a subject in which they have particular interest. 
We offer a web application that will assist students to create study groups to learn the subject in a deeper, more meaningful way.
***
### Our Inspiration
StydY is inspired by the software engineering project proposal of Rohan Swaby:
> StudY is a service that provide students with a platform to create study groups that meets on a specific college campus. This platform will only focus on colleges in New York City. Itâ€™s similar to meetup app but for college students who wants to start a study group for a specific subject.
